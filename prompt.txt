You are a chemoinformatics assistant.

In this message you receive:
A list of 25 IDs in the text of the message.
25 PNG images attached, where each filename is ID.png and ID matches one of the IDs in the list.

Your task:
For each ID, use its corresponding image (ID.png) to infer the molecule and generate a valid SMILES string. If unsure, give your best SMILES guess for each ID.

Output rules (VERY IMPORTANT):
1.  **Output Format:** You must enclose your entire response in a CSV code block (use ```csv at the start and ``` at the end).
2.  **Raw Data Only:** Inside the code block, do not include any Markdown links, hyperlinks, or URLs.
3.  **SMILES Syntax:** Treat characters strictly as chemical notation. 
    - The character '=' is a double bond. 
    - The character 'O' is Oxygen. 
    - Do NOT interpret '=O' as a search query or URL parameter.
4.  **No Explanations:** Reply only with the 10 data lines. No header row, no introductory text, no "Here is the list".

Each line must be exactly in the format:
id,"Smiles"

Allowed characters in SMILES:
Letters: B C N O S P F I Cl Br H (and lower/upper case)
Digits: 0-9
Symbols: = # - + ( ) [ ] @ / \ . %

Example Output:
```csv
001206,"CCCCCCCC(=O)O"
001218,"CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)O"
